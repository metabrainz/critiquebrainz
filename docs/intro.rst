Introduction
============

Setting up the server
---------------------

You can set up CritiqueBrainz server using `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_. It
requires minimum amount of configuration.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you need to create custom configuration file. Copy the skeleton configuration::

   $ cp config.py.example config.py

Then, open ``critiquebrainz/config.py`` in your favourite text editor and update
any variables, as needed.

Configuring MusicBrainz login
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Before you begin using authentication with MusicBrainz accounts,
you need to set ``MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_ID`` and ``MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_SECRET`` values.
To obtain these keys, you need to register your instance of CrituqeBrainz on MusicBrainz.

**Note** ``<your domain>`` field in the urls listed below should probably be set
to ``localhost``, if you plan to run your CritiqueBrainz instance locally
in development mode.

You need MusicBrainz account to register your application. Then head to
https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications/register and follow the instructions.
In ``Callback URL`` field type::

   http://<your domain>/login/musicbrainz/post

Finally, save the obtained ``OAuth Client ID`` and ``OAuth Client Secret`` fields
in your ``config.py`` fields ``MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_ID`` and ``MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_SECRET``
respectively.

Startup
^^^^^^^

Then you can start all the services::

   $ docker-compose up -d

The first time you do that, database initialization is also required::

   $ docker-compose run web python3 manage.py init_db --skip-create-db


Importing data dump
'''''''''''''''''''

We provide daily data dumps from https://critiquebrainz.org that include reviews
and most of the data associated with them. If you want to import that into your
own installation, download archives from ftp://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/critiquebrainz/dump/
(you'll need to get the base archive ``cbdump.tar.bz2`` and one with reviews)
and use ``python3 manage.py export importer`` command. First you need to import
base archive and then one that contains reviews. For example::

   $ docker-compose run web python3 manage.py dump import cbdump.tar.bz2
   $ docker-compose run web python3 manage.py dump import cbdump-reviews-all.tar.bz2

Keep in mind that CritiqueBrainz only supports importing into an empty database.
This should work if you just ran ``init_db`` command.


Testing
-------

Alternative way to test the web server is to use a Docker container::

   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --build
   $ docker logs -f critiquebrainz_web_test_1

Modifying strings
-----------------

CritiqueBrainz supports interface translation. If you add or modify strings that will be displayed
to users, then you need to wrap them in one of two functions: ``gettext()`` or ``ngettext()``.

Before committing changes don't forget to extract all strings into ``messages.pot``::

   $ python3 manage.py update_strings

For more info see :doc:`translation`.
