## About

CritiqueBrainz is a repository for Creative Commons licensed music reviews. Here you can read what other people have written about an album or event and write your own review!

CritiqueBrainz is based on data from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) - open music encyclopedia.
Everyone - including you - can participate and contribute.

CritiqueBrainz is operated by the [MetaBrainz Foundation](https://metabrainz.org)
which has a long-standing history of curating, protecting and making music data available to the
public.

For more information about this project, look at our
[website](https://critiquebrainz.org/).

Changes and other important announcements about the CritiqueBrainz services will be
announced on [our blog](https://blog.metabrainz.org/). If you start using our
services in any production system, we urge you to follow the blog!

## Commercial use

All of our data is available for commercial use. You can find out more about our
[commercial use support tiers](https://metabrainz.org/supporters/account-type) on 
the MetaBrainz site.
