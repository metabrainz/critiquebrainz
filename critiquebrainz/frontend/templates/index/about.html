<h3>{{ _('What is CritiqueBrainz?') }}</h3>
<p>
  {{ _('<strong>CritiqueBrainz is a repository for Creative Commons licensed music and book reviews.</strong>

<h3>{{ _('What is it for?') }}</h3>
<p>
  {{ _('Projects like Wikipedia, MusicBrainz and BookBrainz are good at aggregating information
  about music and books, but their purpose is not suited to expressing opinions.
  CritiqueBrainz fills the gap between raw data and music and book critics.') }}
</p>
<p>
  {{ _('This is an open platform. That means everyone can participate and contribute.
  If you want to share your thoughts, you can rate and/or review an album or a book.
  If you would like, you can read our guide on
  <a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/How_to_write_Good_Critiquebrainz_Reviews">How to Write Good CritiqueBrainz Reviews</a>.
  If you just want to read opinions, that’s fine too.') }}

  {{ _('After reading a review you can mark it as useful or not. This helps other
  music and book enthusiasts find good reviews.') }}
